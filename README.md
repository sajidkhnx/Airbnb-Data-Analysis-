# Airbnb Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Airbnb dataset** to uncover insights about pricing, availability, location trends, and customer preferences. By applying **data analysis and visualization techniques**, we aim to understand patterns in the Airbnb marketplace that can help hosts, travelers, and business stakeholders make informed decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess Airbnb dataset for analysis.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualize insights such as pricing distribution, room type popularity, and location-based availability.
- Detect outliers and anomalies in pricing and reviews.
- Provide actionable insights to improve Airbnb hosting strategies.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains details about Airbnb listings such as:

- **Listing ID**
- **Name & Host Information**
- **Neighbourhood & Location (Latitude, Longitude)**
- **Room Type**
- **Price**
- **Minimum Nights**
- **Number of Reviews**
- **Availability (per year)**


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization

## 📊 Key Analysis & Visualizations

The project covers multiple visualizations and dashboards, including:

1. **Price Distribution** – Histogram & Boxplots to detect outliers.
2. **Room Type Analysis** – Popularity & revenue contribution.
3. **Neighbourhood Insights** – Heatmaps showing density of listings.
4. **Availability Trends** – Seasonal patterns & yearly availability.
5. **Correlation Matrix** – Relationship between price, reviews, and availability.

## 📈 Insights

- Certain neighbourhoods have significantly higher pricing due to demand & location.
- Entire home/apartment is the most booked **room type**, contributing maximum revenue.
- Listings with too high **minimum nights** are less likely to get booked.
- Seasonal trends affect availability, with peaks during vacation periods.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Build a **Machine Learning model** to predict listing price based on features.
- Sentiment analysis on **reviews** for better customer insights.
- Deploy dashboards using **Streamlit / Power BI** for interactive exploration.
